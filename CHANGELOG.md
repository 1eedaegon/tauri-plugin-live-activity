# Changelog

## 0.1.0-alpha.4

- Add npm search keywords and crates.io keywords/categories for Tauri, Live Activities, ActivityKit and Android notifications.
- Add a guarded GitHub Actions release workflow for npm and crates.io.
- Native behavior and the public API are unchanged from alpha.3.

## 0.1.0-alpha.3

- Require Android 8.0 / API 26 in the plugin and demo manifests. The previous API 24 minimum allowed installation on a version where Tauri's Jackson dependency crashes during startup.
- Document OS feature floors, build requirements, desktop limitations and actual boundary-test results separately.
- Refine Mochi's ears and face, using the same silhouette in the app and iOS widget.
- Make Android permission-dialog tests work across API 33 and 37 and native tests run on API 26.

## 0.1.0-alpha.2

- Rename the npm package to `tauri-plugin-live-activity`, matching the crate name.
- Replace the demo with Mochi's snack delivery and nap timer, including a custom iOS widget.
- Keep Android permission requests retryable after the system dialog is cancelled.
- Check notification channel importance before requesting Live Update promotion and report rejected promotion as a degraded feature.
- Reject conflicting iOS updates whose text differs only in Unicode encoding.
- Require iPadOS 17 for iPad and exclude iOS app compatibility mode on Mac.
- Add native permission, timer and lifecycle tests, registry-backed Tauri consumers, and Windows/Linux IPC checks.

## 0.1.0-alpha.1

- Start, update, end and reconcile local progress/timer activities from Tauri 2.
- iOS ActivityKit backend and shared Widget Extension template.
- Android ongoing notifications with explicit fallback and Live Update promotion checks.
- Typed JavaScript API, read-only default Tauri permissions and strict request validation.
- Runnable mobile demo and native lifecycle tests.

Desktop backends, push updates and event subscriptions are not included.
